This project is my first work using SASS. The project is the main page of a website for a company engaged in hot air balloon tours.

While working on the project, I studied SASS features such as creating and using variables and mixins. I also used animations. The page layout is created using grid. Almost all elements of the site are interactive and have some kind of effects and animations.
